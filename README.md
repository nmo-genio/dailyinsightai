## 🧠 What is DailyInsight AI?

**DailyInsight AI** is a personalized journaling and idea management app that uses GenAI to:
- Generate insights and summaries from your journal entries
- Store them securely in the cloud via MongoDB Atlas
- Offer a lightweight, structured way to reflect daily — for personal growth, mood tracking, and idea capture

> 🧪 **Current version** is CLI-based. Web interface coming soon!

---

## 🚀 Features (Current Iteration)

- ✍️ Add free-form journal entries via the command line
- 🧠 Get AI-generated insights (via OpenAI integration)
- 💾 Store data securely in MongoDB Atlas
- 🔐 Manage secrets and config via environment variables in `.env` (e.g., OpenAI key, Mongo URI, and DEBUG mode). Secrets are controlled using environment variables, and debug output can be toggled.
- 🧪 Automated testing using Pytest and GitHub Actions for continuous integration
- 📝 Clear, structured docstrings across all modules
- 🛠️ Project scaffolded using Poetry (dependency + packaging)
